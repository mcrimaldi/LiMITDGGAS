   abstract = {Acidification is a well-known treatment to reduce NH3 emissions from livestock slurries by lowering their pH, but its application at the farm scale is still limited. The acid dosage depends on the acid strength and slurries composition. Acidification does not have a lasting effect and after the acid addition the slurry pH tends to rise due to its buffer system. By studying 54 samples of pig slurry, dairy cattle slurry and digestate, this study aimed to: (i) identify the chemical-physical parameters related to the sulphuric acid (98% w/w) dosage necessary to reduce pH at 5.5, and pH variation over time; (ii) develop predictive models for the acid dosage and the pH after one (pH1w) and two weeks (pH2w) of storage based on slurry composition by using regression trees (RT) and random forests (RF). Acid dosage ranged between 0.8 and 11.7 ml kg−1 increasing with slurry alkalinity, with digestate requiring significantly higher dosage than slurries. Pig slurry showed significantly higher pH increase than the other two slurries. Finally, the pH trend over time was negatively correlated with the solids content. The RF identified the alkalinity and the initial slurry pH as the most important variables in explaining the required acid dosage, while for pH1w and pH2w it identified the total organic carbon and volatile solids. Based on RF results, RT models accurately predicted required acid dosage (r2 = 0.881), the pH1w (r2 = 0.728) and pH2w (r2 = 0.667). Therefore, these simple models can have practical applications for reducing NH3 emissions.},

The sensing system results compact, lightweight, and portable, with a computer interface for an easy end-user operation. The calibration was performed in laboratory environment with certified concentrations. Because of the NH3 large and permanent dipole moment, ammonia QEPAS signal was used to model and characterize adsorption/desorption processes, for an accurate and reliable sensor calibration. At 0.1 s signal integration time, detection limits of 28 ppb, 9 ppb, and 6 ppb were obtained for CH4, N2O, and NH3, respectively. Since these detection limits were well below the natural abundance of the three analytes in atmosphere, the sensor was employed to monitor CH4, N2O, and NH3 concentrations in laboratory air.},

   abstract = {Residue incorporation and organic fertilisation are recommended to increase soil organic matter (SOM) content, thus promoting the provision of multiple ecosystem services. However, the positive effect of crop residue on SOM is often considered rather low, thus requiring a deeper knowledge of their management. In addition, organic fertilisation is thought to be less efficient than mineral. In this context, it is important to understand the response of SOM pools to long-term crop residue incorporation and organic fertilisation and their effect on nutrient cycling and on feed production, in order to judge the sustainability of these practices. We carried out an in-depth multidisciplinary survey to investigate the effect of 28 years of residue incorporation combined with three different nitrogen (N) fertilisation strategies (manure, slurry and mineral) on density fractionated SOM pools differing for their turnover time, and on soil enzymatic activity in a monocropping maize system in NW Italy. Results showed that in the long-term crop production was not altered by organic fertilisation. Organic fertilisation in combination with residue incorporation led to the highest total organic C and total N content down to 90 cm, which was reflected in each SOM pool. In addition, regular applications of crop residue and manures markedly increased C- and N-degrading enzymes, thus enhancing the turnover rates of C and N. We conclude that combining crop residue with organic fertilisation enhanced the provision of regulating services and soil activity, and is a valid approach for maintaining sustainable production in agroecosystems.},

   abstract = {Intensive pig rearing systems produce several air pollutant emissions, mainly associated with housing and slurry storage. Dietary strategies based on the use of feed additives can effectively mitigate such impacts. This work has been aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of dietary zeolites in mitigating ammonia (NH3), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from piggery and slurry storage on finishing pig farms. An experimental trial, in which three groups of approximately 500 pigs each were reared, has been carried out on a commercial pig farm. The three groups were fed the same diet, with the addition of 0 g/kg (Z0, control), 10 g/kg (Z1), and 20 g/kg (Z2) of micronized clinoptilolite (E567), respectively. The emissions from housing facilities and the live and slaughtering animal performances, were assessed. In addition, manure samples were collected during the rearing period to evaluate, at a laboratory scale, the NH3, CO2, CH4, and N2O emission potential during the subsequent slurry storage phase prior to land application. The results have shown that the addition of dietary zeolite can be considered a valid strategy to reduce gaseous emissions from pig houses without affecting animal performances or the system’s overall productivity. Treatment Z2 gave the best results and resulted in a 25% and 36% reduction of NH3 and CO2 equivalent emission fluxes, respectively, compared to those recorded for the control. The laboratory- scale experiment revealed no significant effect of dietary clinoptilolite inclusion on NH3 or the greenhouse gas emission potential during slurry storage.},

Solutions containing 33P radioisotope and 15N-labeled mineral fertilizers were combined with VC at two ratios of organic carbon (Corg) to mineral nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) (OMF7.5C and OMF15C) to simulate OMF granules. Control treatments included unfertilized soil (N0P0), mineral fertilizer (MFNP), and sole VC at two rates (OF7.5C and OF15C). Nitrogen and P uptake by Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) were measured over in 8 weeks. Furthermore, MFNP, OMF7.5C, and OMF15C treatments were incubated for 10 days without plant to measure atom% 15N excess and 33P radioactivity, as indicators of N and P movement from two soil layers (surrounding fertilizer hotspot and below it). In the pot study, OMF15C caused 24% lower biomass and less nutrient recovery derived from fertilizer (N, 11% and P, 8.5%), compared to MFNP. In the incubation study, OMF15C exhibited +19% atom% 15N excess in the combined two soil layers, relative to MFNP, and +28% 33P radioactivity in the soil surrounding the hotspot, and −89% in the soil below it. We interpreted this as a reduction in nutrient availability of the combined VC + mineral fertilizers, due to lower P mobility in soil. The combination of VC with mineral fertilizers can reduce P movement in soil. A higher Corg:N:P ratio resulted in lower nutrient use efficiency in 2 months.},

   abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) in agricultural soils builds up via – among others - the use of organic inputs such as straw, compost, farmyard manure or the cultivation of green manures or cover crops. SOM has benefits for long-term soil fertility and can provide ecosystem services. Farmer behaviour is however known to be motivated by a larger number of factors. Using the theory of planned behaviour, we aimed to disentangle these factors. We addressed the following research question: What are currently the main drivers and barriers for arable farmers in Europe to use organic inputs? Our study focuses on six agro-ecological zones in four European countries (Austria, Flanders [Belgium], Italy and the Netherlands) and four practices (straw incorporation, green manure or cover crops, compost and farmyard manure). In a first step, relevant factors were identified for each practice with farmers using 5 to ten semi-structured interviews per agro-ecological zone. In a second step, the relevance of these factors was quantified and they were classified as either drivers or barriers in a large scale farm survey with 1263 farmers. In the semi-structured interviews, 110 factors that influenced farmer decisions to use an organic input were identified. In the larger farm survey, 60% of the factors included were evaluated as drivers, while 40% were evaluated as barriers for the use of organic inputs. Major drivers to use organic inputs were related to the perceived effects on soil quality (such as improved soil structure or reduced erosion) and the positive influence from social referents (such as fellow farmers or agricultural advisors). Major barriers to use organic inputs were financial (increased costs or foregone income) and perceived effects on crop protection (such as increased weeds, pests and diseases, or increased pesticide use). Our study shows that motivating farmers to use organic inputs requires specific guidance on how to adapt cultivation practices to reduce weeds, pests and diseases for specific soil types, weather conditions, and crops. In addition, more research is needed on the long-term financial consequences of using organic inputs.},

Results demonstrated manure contained approximately 30 and 65% of the OM and N in the daily feed intake, respectively. Additionally, rabbit manure was shown to produce sizeable NH3 and GHG emissions. Specifically, cumulative N losses from storage and subsequent land application averaged 32.4 (NH3) and 2.2% (N2O) of excreted TN; cumulative proportions of OM lost as CO2 and CH4 averaged 51.3 and 0.4%, respectively. Finally, while manure incorporation into the soil effectively abated NH3 emissions, it also showed its potential to increase N2O losses, a potent greenhouse gas (GHG). Future research should focus on identifying appropriate emission mitigation measures. Accurate field-scale measurements are also needed to make data available for the development of a reliable national emission inventory of the investigated gases.},

Adding flocculants can enhance separator efficiency. However, information on the use of chitosan as flocculant for co-digestate and its effects on amended slurry application to soil is scarce. This study undertook a series of trial and error tests to identify the optimal chitosan dose to be applied to co-digestate. Four chitosan doses were evaluated: 120 (Dose 1), 240 (Dose 2), 360 (Dose 3), and 480 (Dose 4) mL L −1 of co-digestate. After optimal dose application, centrifugation was employed to separate the co-digestate (centrifugation tests). We used simple separation indices to evaluate the effectiveness of chitosan addition prior to centrifuge usage. Dose optimization tests results indicated that incremental doses of chitosan had no effect (p > 0.05) on total N and it decreased (p < 0.05) total P removal to solids. Dose 3 showed a superior effect based on the physical characteristics evaluated and on the DM content of the fractions produced. Centrifugation tests results showed chitosan increased (p < 0.05) centrifugation efficiency for K, copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) (75, 36, and 51%, respectively) and had no effect on total N or P. The major findings show that the use of natural and relatively cheap polymer chitosan improves the efficacy of co-digestate centrifugation with respect to K, Cu, and Zn, lowering their load to arable land once a solid fraction is applied.},

Also, little is known about the opinions of stakeholders towards manure treatment. This study aimed to identify stakeholder perceptions of (1) which factors can facilitate and hinder the implementation in practice, (2) which technologies have the most potential for successful adoption, and (3) how farm characteristics and scale of treatment operations affect priorities for technology adoption. This analysis used data from a survey of various stakeholders engaged in manure treatment in four European countries (Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain) that have large areas of high animal density, but diverse socio-economic, political and environmental conditions. Pressure from governmental regulations was perceived as a key factor that stimulated manure treatment in all four countries (70% of respondents). Processing manure to produce bioenergy was considered important in Denmark and Italy, but less important in Spain and the Netherlands. The major barriers to technology adoption were related to economic factors -lack of investment capital (60% of respondents), high processing cost (52%) and a long payback period (45%), while there was relatively little concern regarding transport and noise burden and health risks. Slurry separation and anaerobic digestion were perceived to have the greatest potential for a common adoption. Other preferred technologies were more country-specific (e.g. acidification in Denmark, composting in Spain, and drying and reverse osmosis in Netherlands). Manure treatment was considered to be less applicable at small livestock farms. Separation, composting and acidification were perceived to be more applicable at farm scale, while drying, anaerobic digestion, reverse osmosis at large, industrial scales. Our results imply that manure treatment will remain a regional activity. Policy measures and outreach strategies to alleviate the main barriers to the adoption of manure treatment are suggested.},

   abstract = {Acidification of livestock slurries is used to reduce ammonia and methane emissions, and mechanical separation is applied to concentrate organic matter and nutrients in the resulting solid fraction (SF). The fractions obtained after separation are normally stored on farms during long periods before they can be applied to soil or transported to fields far away. During this storage period and/or transport, the emissions of ammonia and greenhouse gases (GHG) can be high, causing environmental problems.The aim of this study was to assess the effects of acidification before the separation of raw and co-digested pig slurries on the gaseous emissions during the storage of the resulting liquid fraction (LF) and SF. The emission rates of NH3, N2O, CO2, and CH4 were followed during 70 days of storage.Acidification applied before separation significantly reduced the emissions of NH3 and GHG during the storage of the fractions from raw and co-digested slurries. The main reductions were observed in the acidified fractions, relative to the non-acidified fractions (that led to the highest gaseous emissions), in both slurries. Thus, NH3 and CH4 emissions were significantly reduced in acidified LFs and N2O emissions were significantly reduced in acidified SFs. The CO2 emissions were significantly reduced in both acidified fractions from both slurries, since most of the inorganic C was released during the acidification process.It can be concluded that acidification before separation is a good abatement practice to minimize ammonia emissions during separation and to reduce gaseous emissions during the storage of slurry fractions.},

We selected 80 European long-term field experiments that used bovine farmyard manure or bovine liquid slurry, alone (FYM and SLU) or combined with mineral fertilizers (FYMm and SLUm), and compared them to mineral fertilizer only reference treatments. We collected 5570 measurements from 107 papers. FYM produced slightly lower crop yields (−9.5%) when used alone and higher (+11.3%) yields when used in combination with N fertilizer (FYMm), compared to those obtained using mineral fertilizers only. Conditions promoting manure-N mineralization (lighter soil texture, warmer temperature, longer growing season, and shallower incorporation depth) significantly increased the effect of FYM/FYMm on crop yield and yield N. The production efficiency of FYM (yield:N applied ratio) was slightly lower than that of mineral fertilizers (-1.6%). The apparent N recoveries of FYM and FYMm were 59.3% and 78.7%, respectively, of mineral fertilizers. Manured soils had significantly higher C (+32.9% on average for FYM and FYMm) and N (+21.5%) concentrations. Compared to mineral fertilizers, yield was reduced by 9.1% with SLU, but not with SLUm. Influencing factors were similar to those of FYM/FYMm. Efficiency indicators indicated SLU (but not SLUm) was less effective than mineral fertilizers. Slurry significantly increased SOC (on average for SLU and SLUm by +17.4%) and soil N (+15.7%) concentrations. In conclusion, compared to mineral N fertilizers, bovine farmyard manure and slurry were slightly less effective on the crop, but determined marked increases to SOC and soil N, and thus, to long-term soil fertility maintenance.},

During the experimental period, three SF windrows were composted unturned (NTW), while the others three SF windrows were turned (TW) six times: at day 7, 16, 28, 35, 50 and 57. Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and ammonia emissions were measured three times a week for the first 3 weeks and twice per week thereafter for the 72 days of composting. In correspondence of each turning operation, gases emissions rates from TW, were evaluated two times: before and immediately after turning. Due to the production of heat generated during the composting process, high losses of water occurred from both NTW and TW. However, at the end of the trial the average moisture content in composted manure from NTW and from TW resulted, respectively, 46.7% and 34.6%. Therefore, under the specific conditions adopted in this study, composting of pig slurry SF in NTW did not give a suitable product for further pelletizing. In addition, composted manure from NTW resulted in significantly (p < 0.05) lower total nitrogen (2.9% vs 3.4%) and NO3–N (714 mg kg−1 vs 1358 mg kg−1) content. However, in terms of CO2-eq, total gaseous emissions recorded over 72 days of trial from TW (120.4 kg CO2-eq. t−1) were approximately 95% higher as compared to those (64.7 kg CO2-eq. t−1) obtained from NTW.},

Organic fertilization, like compost amendment, may be considered to reach this goal, but there is a need for specific tools to monitor N availability from fertilizers together with their effect on soil biological fertility. In this work, chemical and microbiological indices from soil incubations were evaluated as predictors of crop performance under real conditions. Results from field and laboratory experiments showed some discrepancies for organic fertilization, while mineral N availability and maize N uptake were found in accordance for non-fertilized soils and mineral fertilization. Cumulative mineral N from a 42-day incubation period was a good predictor of N availability to maize, showing that short-term incubations can be used to optimize fertilization management. Moreover, the dynamics of microbial populations involved in the N cycle were able to discriminate between soils with different N mineralization potential, highlighting the effect of fertilization and soil properties on biological fertility.},

It imposed several rules on farmers and public bodies, one of which was nutrient fertilization plan adoption. Here we use results from the Tetto Frati (Northern Italy) Long-Term Experiment to verify the terms and coefficients in the official Italian guidelines and evaluate the limitations imposed to organic fertilization amounts. For this purpose, we mined long-term experimental data of crop yield, N uptake, N use efficiency, and soil organic matter content from miscellanea cropping systems fertilized with farmyard manure (FYM) and bovine slurry (SLU), typical of a dairy farm in Northern Italy. N fertilization efficiency indicators (Removal to Fertilizer ratio, Apparent Recovery and Nitrogen Fertilizer Replacement Value) indicated that in the long run, FYM behaved similarly to urea, and better than SLU. Even N supply rates as high as 250 kg N ha-1 were justified by high rates of crop removal. In fact, among the terms of the mass-balance equation, SOM mineralization was found to be most relevant, followed by meadow rotation residual effects. We conclude that a revised Nitrates Directives application scheme could be more relaxed in its application limit of manure-N, but should be more ambitious in setting efficiency coefficients for manure fertilization.},

OBJECTIVE: The main aims of the work are: i. to support the identification of marginal land for agricultural uses and, specifically, for bioenergy crops in Mediterranean contexts, according to the recent European and worldwide energy crisis; ii. to overturn the vision of these contexts, from problem to opportunity for the relaunch of local economies, the care of the landscape and respect for ecosystems; iii. to support the decision makers activity, for a medium-long term landscape governance and, at the same time, the interests of farmers and local communities, in guaranteeing opportunities for economic growth and environmental/social returns. METHODS: The methodological approach encompasses two main activities: i. the marginal lands identification; ii. the bioenergy scenarios building. They belong to land-use/landscape planning approaches and support the decision makers in the integrations of different criteria and stakeholders points of views. According to literature, the geo-morphologic, agronomic and socio-economic conditions were analyzed using a spatial-multicriteria decision analysis and target modelling tools. The ecosystems services approach, their mapping and quantification, via a dedicated software, were used to support the process still in the analysis phase and in the marginal lands identification one. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A considerably huge area (approximately 7730 km2) was identified as marginal for traditional agricultural uses. Marginality factors are both physical (soil, climatic, agronomic conditions) and social (population structure, depopulation, employment). The study area ecosystem services assessment also confirms lower values than the regional averages. The results highlight the need for decision-makers to monitor these contexts to stem the effects, as well as to provide suitable socio-economic development policies capable of recovering those territories that in the past have held up the regional economy. The energy crops scenarios building can support different production chains (ligno-cellulosic biomass, seeds, oils), and the energy conversion plants types. SIGNIFICANCE: The present work proved to be useful in the meta-analysis study-phase for identifying marginal lands, allowing a significant reduction in analysis costs and times. Although the study is focused on a specific Mediterranean context, the approach can provide scientific guidance for marginal lands identification and management (related to energy crops scenarios) and a support for the ecosystem services restoration. In these terms, the study supports both potential market investors for estimating expected profits, and policy makers for landscape management and land use changes. The integration of multi-criteria assessments and species distribution models supports the choice of specific such as: facing climatic needs, mitigating morphological characteristics, making up for agronomic deficiencies, supporting the population with social policies and incentives for agricultural activities.},

Biochars from pyrolysis of poultry litter (PL) and swine manure (SM) at 400 and 600 °C, and a commonly available wood chip (WC) biochar produced at high temperature (1000 °C) were incorporated to silt-loam (SL) and sandy (SY) soils on a 2% dry soil weight basis. Ryegrass was sown and moisture was adjusted to 60% water filled pore space (WFPS). The PL400 and SM400 biochars significantly increased (p < 0.05) shoot dry matter (DM) yields (SL soil) and enhanced nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) uptake by the plants in both soils, compared to the Control. All biochars significantly increased the soil carbon (C) contents compared to the Control. Total N contents were significantly greater for PL400 and PL600 treatments in both soils. The dehydrogenase activity (DA) significantly increased for PL400 and SM400 treatments and was positively correlated with the volatile matter (VM) contents of the biochars, while β-glucosidase activity (GA) decreased for the same treatments in both soils. All biochars significantly shifted (p ≤ 0.05) the bacterial community structure compared to the Control. This study suggests that pyrolysis of animal manures can produce a biochar that acts as both soil amendment and an organic fertilizer as proven by increased NPK uptake, positive liming effect and high soil nutrient availability, while WC biochar could work only in combination with fertilizers (organic as well as mineral).},

   abstract = {Sustainable development and reducing natural and energy resource consumption are the focus of the policies of many institutions. In this context, livestock farming is one of the major anthropogenic sources of GHG and acidifying gas emissions and requires comprehensive analysis to minimise its ecological footprint. For this reason, it is beneficial to analyse the various processes within this production sector to reduce the consumption of resources, particularly water and soil consumption; reduce energy consumption; and try to valorise the biowaste produced, especially manure, byproducts and wastewater. Reusing residual bioresource and organic waste offers the possibility of valorising a discarded product and, at the same time, reducing the consumption of natural resources. For this purpose, biorefinery processes allow bioresources to be transformed into bioproducts or bioenergy. Therefore, this study investigates the application of biorefinery processes to animal-derived waste, aiming to extract valuable resources while curbing resource consumption. This review analysed 293 scientific papers on biorefinery processes published in the last 11 years applied to livestock biomass to extract relevant information to understand the evolution of this topic and formulate hypotheses regarding future research directions. The analysis strongly emphasizes energy production and a growing interest in insect cultivation. In the coming years, one of the most significant challenges will be the successful transfer of technologies and processes from experimental research to the applied industry. To do this, it will be necessary to reduce costs, exploit economies of scale, improve process management, and develop synergies between different industrial sectors to implement smart circular economy systems. Overall, this review aims to clarify the hypothesis driving research in this area and emphasizes the tangible applications of findings within the broader context of sustainable resource management.},

Kernel density (KD) was used to identify emerging hotspot areas with potentially high concentrations of nitrogen applied to the field. Three KD classification methods were compared: defined interval (DI) into 3 classes (0-170, 170-340, > 340 kg N/ha), quantile (Q) and natural break (NB). The results show that the DI and NB areas correspond to 40 % and 84 % of the total N of buffalo origin in the Campania region, with a N surplus in the hotspot areas localized in nitrate vulnerable zones of 55 and 6 % respectively. The biogas produced from 50 % of the buffalo manure in these areas generates sufficient energy to allow the removal of the N surplus.},

The geographical context of the Piana del Sele (Salerno, Italy) was chosen on the basis of objective criteria, including its relevance in the agro-industrial sector and the availability of accurate and reliable company data that was collected through IT systems, including software business performance monitoring and digital data analysis. This choice was fundamental to guaranteeing the validity and representativeness of our analyses and results. From a methodological point of view, mathematical formulas and algorithms were used, which allowed the calculation of the biogas producibility indices by type of biomass as well as the quantification of the effluents produced to then estimate the quantification of the biogas and the interconnected economic savings. Furthermore, this study uses the SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) approach in an innovative way by integrating renewable energy communities into it. The aim is to demonstrate the potential of biogas plants and how energy communities can transform weaknesses and threats into opportunities. The results show that the integration of biogas plants into the farm environment offers considerable potential, and although it is a challenge for small and medium-sized farms, it could bring energy self-sufficiency and economic surplus. Furthermore, the integration of renewable energy communities would be able to promote the diversification of energy supply and transform weaknesses and threats into opportunities.},

Ammonia Air Stripping from Different Livestock Effluents Prior to and after Anaerobic Digestion. Sustainability 2023, 15, 9402. https://doi. Abstract: Livestock digestate provides nutrients and organic matter to the soil while increasing agricultural sustainability. Nevertheless, nitrogen (N) losses due to the nutrient surplus in regions characterized by intensive animal farming activities still represent an unsolved issue. For this purpose, digestate needs proper treatment and management to avoid N losses in the environment. In the livestock farming context, anaerobic digestion (AD) can be accompanied by an ammonia stripping (AS) process for N recovery. This paper aims to investigate the feasibility AS prior to and after AD of the manure, focusing on two different livestock farms, representative of dairy cattle and pig breeding in southern Italy. AS was performed at a lab scale by injecting microbubbles of air, which allowed the pH to increase, and thus the removal of ammonia. The results show that treating a dairy raw slurry with high intermediate alkalinity (IA) (6707 mg CaCO 3 L −1) with AS may not be convenient in terms of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) reduction. As a matter of fact, the loss of buffering capacity during the stripping process resulted in a pH never exceeding the value of 9, which could not promote free ammonia volatilization, whereas integrating AD with AS allowed us to obtain a 34% higher TAN reduction under the same stripping conditions at a temperature (T) of 38 • C and a gas-to-liquid ratio (G/L) of 1:1. Therefore, the AS removal efficiency strongly depends on the characteristics (mainly IA) of the treated matrix. High IA values suggest a possible high concentration of volatile fatty acids, which hinders pH increases and, thus, enables ammonia stripping. Despite the initial matrix origin, a low IA compared to the total alkalinity (TA) (<20% of TA) ensures a greater ammonia removal efficiency, which could be similar between digestate and raw manure in the same operative process conditions. Nonetheless, the amount of ammonia stripped is related to the initial TAN concentration of the specific matrix.},

Abstract: This study investigates the dark fermentation of fruit and vegetable waste under mesophilic conditions (30-34 • C), as a valorization route for H 2 and volatile fatty acids production, simulating the open market waste composition over the year in two Mediterranean countries. Specifically, the study focuses on the effect of the (i) seasonal variability, (ii) initial pH, and (iii) substrate/inoculum ratio on the yields and composition of the main end products. Concerning the seasonal variation, the summer and spring mixtures led to +16.8 and +21.7% higher H 2 production than the winter/autumn mixture, respectively. Further investigation on the least productive substrate (winter/autumn) led to 193.0 ± 7.4 NmL of H 2 g VS −1 at a pH of 5.5 and a substrate/inoculum of 1. With the same substrate, at a pH of 7.5, the highest acetic acid yield of 7.0 mmol/g VS was observed, with acetic acid corresponding to 78.2% of the total acids. Whereas a substrate/inoculum of 3 resulted in the lowest H 2 yield, amounting to 111.2 ± 7.6 NmL of H 2 g VS −1 , due to a decrease of the pH to 4.8, which likely caused an inhibitory effect by undissociated acids. This study demonstrates that dark fermentation can be a valuable strategy to efficiently manage such leftovers, rather than landfilling or improperly treating them.},

Storage conditions were simulated in a small-scale application in a climate-controlled room. Results showed that the higher organic matter content of cow raw slurry facilitated the surface crust formation starting from the first days of storage. AD with SLS increased ammonia emissions (48.5%) due to the increase of the ammoniacal nitrogen content. On the other hand, animal manure covered with a layer of straw showed a 7.3% reduction of ammonia emissions. This study suggests that treatments and covering strategies must be calibrated to different manure types to enhance the mitigation effect.},

   abstract = {Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a mature technology commonly used for manure treatment, both for the stabilisation of waste and for the production of energy. The introduction of new incentives could represent an opportunity for biogas production, when the current feed-in-tariffs, which improved the financial feasibility of AD plants producing electricity will end. This paper examines the feasibility of reconverting an existing AD biogas production plant into a biomethane production plant. The AD plant, in this case study, is a two-stage reactor situated in the centre of Italy and mainly fed with livestock manure from both cows and buffaloes. The economic analysis of two hypotheses is provided: i) continuing the electricity production from biogas after the end of the current incentives (2025); ii) considering the new incentives program for the biomethane and reconverting the plant, using hollow-fibre membranes for the purification of the raw biogas (SEPURAN® Green modules, EnviTec). For this purpose, investment and operating costs, based on plant monitoring data (2105.3 m3 d-1, Biogas production; 4432.9 kWh d-1, electricity production) as well as on market analysis for costs evaluation were considered. The mean biogas production for the considered year was about 30% less than the expected production, indicated by producer, highlighting the need for the optimisation of the management of the reactors. Moreover, based on the averaged methane production (June 2017-June 2018), results show that: i) plant conversion for the biomethane production is not suitable for small-scale plants, due to the high investment costs of upgrading technology (1.2 M€); ii) when current incentives end, the electricity production from biogas in the current plant may not be self-sufficient, due to the highly expensive operating costs. This paper provides a first analysis of the possible fate of the biogas plants under the new incentives.},

   abstract = {Agriculture is still the main source of NH3 emissions. Consequently, ammonia reduction and monitoring are included in the strict EU targets. Unfortunately, the main issue with the quantification of NH3 emissions is that some uncertainties are still related to NH3 volatilization measurements, mainly because of the absence of a standard measurement technique. This study compares two different methods for measuring NH3 fluxes: the Integrated Horizontal Flux (IHF) method used with glass tubes and the wind tunnels (WT) with acid traps, in order to provide further insights into quantification of NH3 emissions. Specifically, three field trials were carried out, using different fertilizers on bare soil: urea, raw manure and liquid separated digestate from Mediterranean buffalo cows (Bubalus bubalis L.). Results show that the same diurnal flux variations for both methods was observed, except for those in urea trials, mainly because of the dynamics of urea volatilization. Generally, WT underestimated ammonia emissions, especially during the first six hours of experimentation, since the fixed air speed inside the tunnel is lower than the outside wind speed at the same height. Cumulative ammonia volatilization measured with WT differs from those measured with IHF by 32% (urea), 43% (raw manure) and 46% (liquid separated digestate), respectively. Moreover, WT estimations seemed to be affected by a short exposition time of the acid traps, demonstrating a poor correlation of IHF and WT method within 2–3 h. Indeed, linear correlation between two methods was improved to R2 = 0.92, by increasing the minimum samplers exposition time up to 3 h.},

   abstract = {The post-treatment of biomass from phytoremediation is not yet a well-established practice due to the risk induced by the presence of Potentially Toxic Elements (PTEs). Pyrolysis is a thermochemical treatment that reduces the volume and weight of contaminated matter producing a combustible vapor phase and a solid residue (char). A key factor enhancing the economic and the environmental sustainability of biomass valorization through pyrolysis is the production of a market value char. A proper choice of the pyrolysis operating conditions should take into account the effect of final temperature on PTEs release, on the char physicochemical properties as well as on the mobility of retained PTEs. In particular, in this work the influence of both the temperature and the plant parts is discussed (branches and leaves of Populus Nigra L. and rhizomes and culms of Arundo donax L.) on the release of Cd, Pb, Cu, and Zn in the temperature range 653–873 K under steam assisted slow pyrolysis conditions. The mobility of the heavy metals retained in the chars was also studied as well as the product yields, the gas composition and char porosity. The results suggested that in presence of Cd it is necessary to operate at low-temperature (lower than 703 K) to obtain a heavy metals free vapor phase fuel, whereas in presence of one or more metals among Pb, Cu, and Zn, it is possible to conduct a pyrolytic treatment at higher temperatures, thus obtaining a char with high BET surface area and lower metals mobility.},

In this study a comparative analysis of the yields and characteristics of char obtained from slow pyrolysis of five uncontaminated biomasses (Populus nigra, Salix alba, Fraxinus oxyphylla, Eucalyptus occidentalis and Arundo donax) was carried out under steam atmosphere to better develop char porosity. Moreover, the dependence of the properties of solid residue on the process final temperature was studied for E. occidentalis in the temperature range of 688–967 K. The results demonstrate that, among the studied biomasses, chars from P. nigra and E. occidentalis have to be preferred for applications regulated by surface phenomena given their highest surface area (270–300 m2/g), whereas char from E. occidentalis is the best choice when the goal is to maximize energy recovery.},

   abstract = {Livestock and agricultural activities contribute significantly to atmospheric ammonia emission in Europe. The volatilization process depends on many factors, especially wind speed and rainfall. The most important methods to evaluate ammonia volatilization are the wind tunnel and micrometeorological methods. The tunnels are more flexible and simple to use in every situation. Few studies have been carried out to determine, which conditions are established inside the chamber and how they influence the ammonia volatilization and measurement.The aim of this research was to investigate the effects of the wind tunnel configuration and flow inlet velocity, by means of CFD simulations and wind speed measurements, in order to achieve a better aerodynamic performance. The SST k-ω model used for simulations was first validated in order to prove the consistency of the model itself. Several configurations were simulated and compared. In particular, in order to overcome the asymmetric flow conditions that occurred in all wind tunnel configurations, four flow distribution devices were proposed and simulated. The best setup was chosen with the purpose of reaching both the best uniform velocity distribution (to ensure homogeneous volatilization from the emitting surface) and easy transport for field applications. It consists of an emission chamber 40 cm wide, 25 cm high and 80 cm long, situated between a divergent diffuser and a convergent duct, respectively 50 cm and 25 cm long. Moreover, structures similar to honeycombs, namely guiding channels, were introduced in the divergent diffuser, because they showed the best aerodynamic performance. These 20 channels, located in the divergent diffuser, prevent flow from separating, by means of the reduction of the expansion angle, obtaining the desired flow conditions inside the wind tunnel. Finally, it was verified that CFD confirmed its usefulness as a decision-support instrument to design and simulate possible solutions, reducing design time.},

   abstract = {Ammonia emission reduces the reliability and nitrogen (N) fertilizer efficiency of animal manure and mineral fertilizers applied to fields. The loss of ammonia to the atmosphere is frequently compensated for by costly over-application of N fertilizers. New technologies to reduce ammonia emission are regularly developed, and their efficacy needs to be tested using accurate methods. To date, a major obstacle to many available emission measurement techniques is the requirement of large plot sizes of homogeneous surface characteristics, which particularly is a challenge to the number of plot-level replicates that can be carried out on a field providing uniform surface characteristics throughout. The objectives of this research were to test three different methods for measuring NH3 flux when applied to small plots (<315 m2) by comparison with conventional micrometeorological methods and to determine the labor intensity and expenses related to the respective methods in their entirety. The integrated horizontal flux (IHF) method and the ZINST method were used with passive flux Leuning samplers as micrometeorological reference methods. As examples of conventional small-plot in situ emission measurement techniques, wind tunnels measuring gas-phase ammonia using ALPHA passive diffusion samplers and a flux chamber method using Dräger tubes for measurements of ammonia concentration (DTM) were used. As an inexpensive alternative small-plot method, we studied the feasibility of applying ALPHA passive diffusion samplers and battery-driven cup anemometers at ZINST height on small source areas (<315 m2), coupled with a backward Lagrangian stochastic (bLS) dispersion model to calculate emission fluxes (referred to as the AbLS method). When exposure duration was appropriate and weather conditions were not extreme, tests showed no significant difference in NH3 emission fluxes measured with AbLS, compared to those obtained with IHF and ZINST using Leuning samplers. However, the AbLS method did not give reliable emission measurements in periods with high wind speeds and heavy rain. It was also shown that the AbLS method provided valid results when reducing the plot radius from the standard 20 m to 10 m, or even 5 m, provided that the ALPHA samplers were exposed for at least 5 or 6 h. Emission from 200 kg urea-N ha-1 was between 20 and 30 kg N ha-1 in the two trials. The cost for one study running for one week using the ZINST or bLS methodology, including equipment for four plots and eight measurement intervals, was $2785 if horizontal fluxes were measured using the ALPHA samplers, compared to $12,301 using the Leuning samplers and $13,928 using gas washing bottles. Using the DTM flux chamber method once is a little more expensive than using the AbLS method, but less expensive if the cost of purchasing the equipment is distributed over five studies in five years. Using wind tunnels is as costly as measuring emissions with the Leuning samplers or gas washing bottles using the bLS or ZINST method.},

In addition, the data required for effective decision making is often inadequate or even lacking, thus constraining the planning process. In this study, a methodology for participatory appraisal of technologies, integrating desirability functions to the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT)-analytical hierarchy process (AHP) methodology was developed. Application of the methodology was illustrated with an example for participatory appraisal of four bioenergy technologies in Uganda. Results showed that the methodology is effective in evaluating stakeholder preferences for bioenergy technologies. It showed a high potential to be used to identify and rate factors that stakeholders take into consideration when selecting bioenergy systems.

   abstract = {This research compares the operation of one-stage and two-stage anaerobic continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) systems fed semi-continuously with food waste. The main purpose was to investigate the effects of ammoniacal nitrogen on the anaerobic digestion process. The two-stage system gave more reliable operation compared to one-stage due to: (i) a better pH self-adjusting capacity; (ii) a higher resistance to organic loading shocks; and (iii) a higher conversion rate of organic substrate to biomethane. Also a small amount of biohydrogen was detected from the first stage of the two-stage reactor making this system attractive for biohythane production. As the digestate contains ammoniacal nitrogen, re-circulating it provided the necessary alkalinity in the systems, thus preventing an eventual failure by volatile fatty acids (VFA) accumulation. However, re-circulation also resulted in an ammonium accumulation, yielding a lower biomethane production. Based on the batch experimental results the 50% inhibitory concentration of total ammoniacal nitrogen on the methanogenic activities was calculated as 3.8. g/L, corresponding to 146. mg/L free ammonia for the inoculum used for this research. The two-stage system was affected by the inhibition more than the one-stage system, as it requires less alkalinity and the physically separated methanogens are more sensitive to inhibitory factors, such as ammonium and propionic acid.},

However, there are concerns about the sustainability of biomass supplies and the environmental impacts resulting from their use. Use of residues could contribute to ensuring sustainable supply of biomass energy. This study presents findings of an evaluation of the energy potential of agricultural and forest residues in Uganda using census data of the year 2008/2009. Annual productions of crop and forest residues were estimated using residue-to-product ratio (RPR) method. Energy potential of each residue class was then determined basing on their respective lower heating values. The biogas generation potential of each animal category was used to evaluate the energy potential of animal manure. Results showed that the total energy potential of the residues amount to 260PJy-1, which is about 70% of gross biomass energy requirement of Uganda for the year 2008. Crop residues had the highest contribution of about 150PJy-1, followed by animal residues with a potential of 65PJy-1. Maize residue is the predominant crop residue with energy potential of 65PJy-1 followed by beans and banana, each at 16PJy-1. This study indicates that agricultural and forest residues can be a major renewable energy source for Uganda.

The two models were developed by adapting the potential evapotranspiration (ETo) models of Tombesi-Lauciani and Hargreaves. The data used for assessing the manure evaporation in situ, were derived from the manure weights recorded using an experimental platform installed within the farmyard and equipped with load cells. The experiments were carried out in Serre (SA), in the South of Italy in the period from 23 June to 24 September 2011. The most efficient model, in terms of closeness between estimates and measures, was implemented from 2006 to 2010, allowing for annualised calculation of evaporation. On this basis, an optimal management strategy was established, which corresponds to maximising manure evaporation, minimising the use of the scraper from the 100th day of the year (DOY) to the 250th DOY. This leads to a potential reduction in weight of the manure by 650 kg m-2 [yard] year-1, which corresponds to management cost reduction of about 30%. © 2013 IAgrE.},

   abstract = {Biomass is a renewable energy resource; however, its exploitation raises concerns about its ability to sustain the growing demand and its negative impacts on the environment, particularly in developing countries. These concerns are more prominent on the African continent where high population growth rates is leading to high rates of deforestation due to expansion of agricultural land and increased demand for bioenergy. Use of traditional and inefficient bioenergy technologies and appliances also exacerbate the problem. This paper presents a review of the efforts and progress made by different organisations in promoting improved bioenergy technologies in Uganda. The study was based on an extensive review of available literature on improved bioenergy technologies introduced in the country. It was found that there is high level of wastage of biomass resources since an estimated 72.7% of the population use traditional cooking stoves with efficiency estimated to be less than 10%. Inefficient cooking stoves are also blamed for indoor air pollution and respiratory illness reported amongst its users. Modern bioenergy technologies such as biomass gasification, cogeneration, biogas generation, biomass densification, and energy-efficient cooking stoves have been introduced in the country but have certainly not been widely disseminated. The country should pursue policies that will accelerate proliferation of more efficient bioenergy technologies in order to reduce the negative environmental impacts of bioenergy utilisation and to ensure sustainability of biomass supplies. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Buffalo livestock plays a central role in the regional economy in some areas of southern Italy, through the production of mozzarella cheese. With about 250,000 heads per utilizable agricultural area (equal to 107,400 ha), livestock husbandry is intensive. An important issue with regard to high animal density is manure management, an activity determined by cost optimization and the laws governing environmental sustainability. According to community, national and international rules (European Directive 91/676, Italian rules 152/99 and 258/00), nitrate leakage is considered a pollution indicator related to breeding activities and must be kept within limits. Simulation studies were carried out in the Italian province of Caserta to evaluate the impact of leakage on groundwater. Manure was also collected from 35 livestock farms and the nitrogen content measured in the laboratory. The results showed an average content of 2 kg/m 3 of nitrogen, corresponding to 50 kg per animal and year, while the nitrate concentrations in the groundwater were found to be lower than those predicted by simulation. The nitrogen content found in buffalo manure <60% of the standard content produced by the bovine species (on average 83 kg nitrogen per adult animal per year). The fact that the bovine species is used as the standard reference for legislation on nitrogen production explains the inconsistency observed between the impact of buffalo livestock on the environment predicted by simulation and the nitrate concentration measured in the groundwater. Although it would be out of line with current regulations, it would theoretically be possible to increase the buffalo load on the territory without environmentally negative effects. Therefore, in this context, the common referral points, i.e. the American Midwest Point Service and others usually consulted for the assessment of livestock impact in terms of nutritional excretion and the risk of pollution for the environment, should be revisited.},
