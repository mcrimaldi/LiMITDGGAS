The project will benefit the cooperation of a group of scientists from different field of expertise, with different approaches and methodology trying to overcome current constraints of manure based digestate chain.
Basing on the background presented, the objectives of this project are:

* Evaluation of different treatment techniques for manure based digestate to improve the effectiveness of nutrient recovery
* Assessment of fertilization efficiency of raw and treated effluents produced by the treatment plants
* Monitoring of gaseous emissions (NH3, N2O, CH4 and CO2) along the treatment phases and after application of digestate to the soil
* Providing of a dataset for the development of the ALFAM2 project ([https://projects.au.dk/alfam/](https://projects.au.dk/alfam/)) to improve comprehension and prediction of ammonia losses from field-applied digestate in the Mediterranean climate conditions.
* Assessment of techno economic feasibility of the processes
* Landscape analysis for the identification of high livestock density areas and spreading scenarios

##### Fig.1 - Scheme of the approach adopted

Each one of these objectives will be developed according to a proper methodology described in detail as follows:

1. ### Treatment techniques for animal manure digestate: characterization of effluents and improvement of separation efficiency

   Treatment strategies considered for the aim of the project, are adopted in two already existing plants for the treatment of livestock effluents, located in Piedmont and Campania region. Specifically, one treatment is based on a sorbent barrier made of zeolite, acting as a trap for nutrients, purifying the liquid fraction of the digestate. The second technology selected is based on ammonia stripping from the liquid fraction of the digestate, followed by an enrichment in NH4 of the solid digestate used as a filter for gas leaving the stripping tower. The enriched filter is used as a bulk agent for vermicompost. This system is patented as Green Cycle System (GCS). Both plants produce a fertilizer or amendment certified. Both the process will be analyzed as a whole, from digestate production to the agronomic utilization of the output materials. For each treatment step, energy requirement, nutrients mass balance, NH3 and GHG losses will be monitored, to evaluate the economic and environmental sustainability of the whole process. A more detailed description of the functioning of the two processes, and of the activities to develop are reported as follows.

   #### 1.1 Implementing and assessment of an innovative full-scale prototype system based on zeolite as adsorbent (UniTO)

   An existing prototype system for nutrient recovery from digestate will be implemented and tested at the biogas plant of the MAGIM – Società Cooperativa Agricola, a pig farm located in Racconigi, in the Cuneo Province. The farm rears 3,000 sows (weight 180 kg), 1,000 piglets (up to 3 months old and weight 30 kg), and 3,000 fattening pigs (weight 90 kg). The total utilized agricultural area is 500 ha, devoted to cereal (mainly maize) production. Since December 2012 a biogas plant with an installed capacity of 0.800 MWel has been operating at the farm. The biogas plant is mainly fed with pig manure (raw slurry, separated solid fraction of raw slurry)
   and energy crops produced by the pig farm. An innovative digestate post-treatment system developed by E.S.E.A. Co.Lt., based on a two-stage solid/liquid separation unit combined with a zeolite filter unit (Figure 3) for digested liquid fraction nutrient recovery, has been recently installed to improve the overall sustainability of the anaerobic digestion system. Digestate from the biogas plant is separated with a screw press separator to obtain a solid (SF1) and a liquid (LF1) fraction.

   A highly efficient separation device (e.g., decanter centrifuge) further separates the LF1, and the obtained supernatant (LF2) is then filtered through a specific zeolites bed characterized by high Cation-exchange capacity (C.E.C.).

   The output products are:

   - digested solid fraction from the screw press and from the decanter centrifuge, available for a composting process;
   - digested liquid fraction (percolate) from the sorbent zeolite filter with a reduced nutrient content that can be spread to the field crops through fertigation;
   - nutrient-enriched zeolite used for the industrial production of commercial organic or organo-mineral fertilizer.

   The process is aimed at:

   - reducing nutrient content of the processed manure, lowering the farm livestock rate
   - facilitating the territorial re-equilibrium of manure nutrients load, through the delocalization of the commercial organic or organo-mineral fertilizer
   - reducing NH3 and GHG emissions.

   The efficiency of the system is determined by several parameters such as the type of used zeolite, operational parameters (eg., slurry flow rate) and chemical and physical characteristics (e.g., particle size and total solids content) of digestate, which can be very heterogeneous. An investigation conducted by DISAFA revealed frequent stops of the system, mainly due to operational problems (e.g., clogging) of the decanter centrifuge. Moreover, digestate centrifugation is a process requiring high capital costs and a high-power input. Therefore, An analysis of existing options will be carried out to identify an economical and reliable method for
   digestate separation. Then, the efficacy of the system in recovering nutrients from digestate will be evaluated through the analyses of the physical and chemical characteristics (e.g., total solids – TS, total nitrogen - TN, total ammonia nitrogen - TAN, total phosphorus - TP, total potassium - TK, zinc – Zn, and copper – Cu) of the inlet and the output materials (both solid and liquid fractions) at each treatment step.

   #### 1.2 Investigation of the efficiency of the Green Cycle System (GCS) technology (UniNA)

   The GCS developed by the CF Energy Service S.r.l., is aiming at integrating livestock manure treatment and the production of sterilized bio-based fertilizers (Fig.2). The plant is located in Capaccio (SA), a small town in the Salerno Province, where are reared more than 20000 buffalo heads for milk production. The plant is fed by three surroundings buffalo farms, connected by pipelines. The total daily processing capacity is of 20500 kg/day of different agricultural organic waste, divided as follows: 78% buffalo manure, 12 % olive mill wastewater, 3% dairy serum, and 7% agricultural waste. The system is made up of an anaerobic digester of about 3600 m3, (with an installed capacity of 249 kWel) followed by a stripping tower and an open vermicomposting process of the digestate solid fraction. Specifically, the liquid digestate is forced into the stripping tower, where it is invested by the high temperature of exhaust gases from the combined heat and power (CHP) generator. The gases are conveyed and circulated from the bottom of the tower, while the liquid fraction of digestate is nebulized from the top. The ammonium is then extracted with a blower and the sucked flow is then conveyed into a biofilter where it meets the remaining solid fraction of the digestate.

   ![alt text](/img/projfig2.png)

   ##### Fig.2 - Scheme of the Green Cycle System

   The biofilter retains the ammonia and converts it into organic nitrogen, and the high temperatures suppress pathogenic germs and weed seeds present in the solid fraction. The earthworm breeding produces a fertilizer rich in humic and fulvic acids, which can be used in organic agriculture. This type of treatment plant is not reported before in the scientific literature, for this reason, advantages and constraints of this promising approach are still unknown. From a previous assessment on different sampling points of the plant, some unexpected results were found such as the presence of torrefied material in the liquid stripped fraction that is worthy of investigation. To this purpose, the main characteristics (TS, VS, total N and TAN, total phosphorus - TP, total potassium - TK, zinc – Zn, and copper – Cu) of the influent and effluent materials will be monitored twice per month, for one year, in order to evaluate the treatment efficiency and characterize all the effluents of the plant. The effluents to be characterized and tested for agronomic utilization are the following:

   - Raw digestate (immediately after the biodigester)
   - Liquid fraction downstream of stripping tower with reduced nutrient content
   - Solid fraction of the digestate
   - Solid fraction after vermicomposting

2. ### Assessment of fertilization efficiency of all the effluents of the treatment plants (UniTO and UniNA)

   Activities to assess the agronomic value of the effluents (Subedi et al., 2016) will be carried out at mesocosm scale. A set of experiments in controlled or semi-controlled conditions will be performed at two sites, UNITO and UNINA. Treatments will include raw and treated digestates produced in the treatment plants, an unfertilized control, and a control treated with mineral fertilizers. The plant grown in optimal conditions will be used as a bio-indicator of the nutrient-use efficiency. Crop biomass production and nutrient uptake will be used to calculate standard nutrient use efficiency indicators. This finding will be used to evaluate the nutrient availability for the crop and to demonstrate the environmental and agronomic performance of improved digestate management chains. In detail, two sets of mesocosm experimental units will be arranged for soils with contrasting physico-chemical properties to compare different fertilization treatments (raw and processed liquid and solid manures for a total of at least 4 manures; mineral fertilization treatment, and unfertilised control as references). Parallel experiments will be set in the two units UNINA and UNITO. Italian Ryegrass (L. multiforum) (Figure 4), a key-crop of Italian forage-cropping systems, will be used as a bioindicator of nutrient availability.

   The crop will be cut twice to assess also the medium-term fertilizer efficiency. Mesocosm will be grown in semi-controlled conditions to ensure a good crop status and growth. Fertilizers will be mixed with the mesocosm soil and Italian ryegrass will be sown, thus simulating a pre-sowing distribution followed by tillage. irrigation will be performed based on a simple water balance calculation and leaching will be measured or prevented. At least three replicates will be performed for each treatment. Soil texture analysis will be conducted using the Bouyoucos hydrometric method. Soil pH and EC will be measured on 1:2.5 and 1:5 soil (g) water (mL) suspensions, respectively. Soil nitrogen (total N) concentration will be assessed after mineralization with sulfuric acid (96%) in the presence of potassium sulfate and a low concentration of copper by the Kjeldahl method. Mineral N will be determined spectrophotometrically (FIAstar 5000 Analyzer, FOSS Analytical, Hillerød, Denmark) on soil extracts. Gas semi-permeable membrane method (ISO11732 procedure) will be carried out for NH4-N, while the sulphanilamide-naphtylethylendiamine dihydrochloride method will be carried out to analyze NO3 − after nitrate to nitrite reduction with a copper–cadmium column (ISO 13395 procedure). Soil P content will be measured according to the Olsen method while ammonium acetate method will be adopted for exchangeable K. Scheibler calcimeter will be used for determination of soil limestone content. Soil C will be measured according to the Walkley–Black method and reported as soil organic matter (SOM% = C% × 1.726). Plant dry tissues will be finely ground in an electric mill (Wiley mill-IKA, MF10.1, Staufen, Germany) for determination of the total N (Kjeldahl method). Total phosphorous in plant tissues will be determined by a colorimetry on the wet digested dry sample Plant N and P uptake will be estimated by multiplying dry biomass by nutrient concentration of plant tissues. A simplified N and P balance will be assessed as the difference between plant uptake and nutrient inputs supplied by fertilization. Plant nutrient uptake measured on the unfertilized control soils will be used to assess soil native availability of monitored nutrients, while soil NP variations and plant uptake on both fertilized/unfertilized soils will be involved in calculations of nutrient use efficiency according to Congreves et al. (2021).

3. ### Measurement of emissions during the digestate processing, and from treatment effluents storage and field application

   Gaseous emissions from digestate treatment plants, storage and field application of the treatment effluents will be measured according to different available techniques. For instance, two distinct situations will be identified:

   1. emissions at treatment plant;
   2. emissions after soil application of each effluent of treatment plant.

   Static or dynamic chambers will be adopted in the first case while methods for measuring concentration in the air, transforming it into emissions with dispersion models, will be used together with chambers in the second case. For each individual situation, methodology will be described in the specific section.

   #### 3.1 Measurements of emissions from full-scale prototype system based on zeolite as adsorbent (UNITO)

   At biogas plant, ammonia and GHG emissions from all emitting sources (solid fractions from separation process, the sorbent zeolite filter, percolate from the sorbent zeolite filter) will be evaluated by using a set of wind tunnels (Balsari et al., 2007) coupled with a Photoacoustic analyzer (QEPAS). Each wind tunnel (Figure 5) consists of a fan, a hose, a mixing chamber, the tunnel body, pontoons made of stainless-steel pipes, an expansion chamber and a sampling point. Each trial will last for 3 months with at least 2 sampling a week.

   ![alt text](/img/projimg5.png)

   ##### Fig.5 - a wind tunnel system floated on a digested slurry tank

   #### 3.2 Measurements of emissions from Green Cycle System (UniNA)

   Measurements will be conducted both at laboratory and open field conditions, for different purposes. Specifically, laboratory tests will be implemented in order to quantify emissions of NH3, CH4 and N2O considering the storage conditions of the following materials:

   1. liquid fraction of digestate downstream the stripping tower;
   2. liquid fraction of digestate downstream the anaerobic digestion;
   3. Solid fraction of digestate downstream the anaerobic digestion;
   4. digestate downstream the anaerobic digestion.

   For the purpose, dynamic chamber technique will be considered to measure NH3 emissions (Figure 6). With this procedure is possible to simulate both storage conditions and soil applications. The air sample will be analyzed using a gas-sensitive semiconductor and electrochemical sensors (Aeroqual, series 500) to detect the real-time NH3. The fluxes will be calculated from the airflow rate and concentrations value of the inlet and outlet. Vessels containing effluents to be tested will be positioned a climate-controlled room (2 m (H) 2,5 m (W) 2,5 m (L)) (Scotto di Perta et al., 2020). GHG will be measured by vented chamber described by Parkin and Venterea, 2010. Gaseous sampling at times 0, 20 and 40 min will be performed by inserting a polypropylene syringe into the chamber septa and slowly removing a gas sample. The sample can be stored directly in the syringe, before being analyzed in the gas chromatograph. Gaseous emissions will be then calculated according to Collier et al. (2014) and Parkin and Venterea (2010).

   Moreover, a low-cost acid traps-open chamber (Figure 7) introduced and calibrated by Araújo et al. (2009) will be used to measure NH3 emissions at treatment plant, during the enrichment of the solid fraction of digestate with exhaust gas from the stripping tower.

   ##### Fig.7 - Schematic of an open chamber for NH3 measurements (Jantalia et al., 2012)

   #### 3.3 Open field ammonia emissions assessment after application to the soil of treatment plants effluents (UniNA and UniTO)

   In order to provide a good dataset for ALFAM2 (<https://projects.au.dk/alfam/>) different techniques will be adopted. Ammonia emissions after application of the treatment effluents will be assessed applying a micrometeorological method, by means of passive ammonia samplers (alpha-samplers, Tang et al., 2018). This technique will be used to measure emissions from treatment plant effluents applied to the field. The number and position of the mast to be used (each with three passive samplers) will be defined according to the application. The backward Langrangian stochastic (bLS) dispersion model will be used to infer the total NH3 emission, using "WindTrax" software, described in detail in Flesch et al. (2004) and available at <http://www.thunderbeachscientific.com>. Ammonia emission after field applications will be measured using three wind tunnels (Scotto di Perta et al., 2016) already in the availability of UniNA, consisting of an open chamber placed on a rectangular area (0.32 m2), which simulate the wind action on a fertilized surface by means of a fan (Figure 8).

   ##### Fig.8 - Wind tunnels measuring ammonia emission from bare soil

   #### 3.4 Open field GHG emissions assessment after application to the soil of treatment plants effluents (UNITO)

   Field scale experiments will be carried out on plots of about 700 m2 each, via a closed static chamber method (Figure 9) according to Bertora et al. (2018). The technique provides for the insertion of a steel anchor (15 cm depth) into the soil, to isolate a soil column preventing lateral gas diffusion. The anchors remain inserted into the soil for the whole growing season. For each measurement point the chamber will be covered with a sealed and isolated steel lid. Three air samples will be taken from the chamber via a plastic syringe, at 0, 10 and 20 minutes from chamber closure, then transferred into glass vials to be analysed by gas chromatography for CO2, CH4, and N2O concentration. The gas accumulation pattern will be used to calculate GHG soil flux over time.

4. ### Providing of a dataset for the development of the ALFAM2 project (UNINA and UniTO)

   In order to provide a dataset for the development of the ALFAM2 project (<https://projects.au.dk/alfam/>) for comprehension and predicting ammonia loss from field-applied manure in different environmental conditions and manure of various animal species, field experimental trials will be carried out, using treatment plants effluents. Specifically, NH3 emissions will be measured with different techniques (chambers and  micrometeorological methods), together with soil and fertilizers characteristics and weather conditions. Dataset will be organized according to recommendations listed at section 3.5 of Hafner et al. (2018)

5. ### Assessment of techno economic feasibility of the processes

   To analyze the economic feasibility of the two hypotheses of digestate treatment system, costs and revenues components will be evaluated. The investment and operating costs will be discussed, based on plant operators’ data as well as on the market analysis for costs evaluation. In order to compare the two hypotheses, the Net Present Value (NPV) and the internal rate of return are used as valuation criteria (Scotto di Perta et al., 2019). Specifically, NPV is the sum of the expected net cash flows measured in today’s currency (Gebrezgabher et al., 2010) (Eq 1):
$$
\displaystyle NPV=-CC+\sum_{t=0}^n \frac{CF_t}{(1+r)^t}
$$

   where CC is the initial capital cost, r is the discount factor and CF is the expected cash flow at time t. Generally, CF is a function of incomes related to the different systems and operating costs. The income per year is given by Equation 2:

$$
\displaystyle INCOME_0=[(T_e*EP)*365]
$$

   where TE is the price of the sale of electricity produced and EP (kWh d–1) is the electrical power produced per hour.

6. ### Landscape Analisys

   Starting from the awareness that the effects of livestock farming are not limited to the field scale, a territorial scale analysis will be performed to support and integrate mitigation strategies (Cervelli et al., 2021). The work will entail three main steps:

   1.  First step is the building of the landscape “Demand” corresponding to the quantification of nitrogen applied to the field, derived from the consistency and composition of the herds in the study area.

   2. “Focus Area” (FA) identification. The FAs are the hotspots with the highest concentration of nitrogen in the field.

   3. Landscape “Offer” creation, that is the identification of suitable areas for manure treatment plants or slurry spreading activities. A scenario-based Spatial-MultiCriteria Decision Analysis process (Figure 10) will be developed, supported by the panel of experts’ opinions (compared to those of different types of stakeholders), in order to identify the areas suitable for collective treatment plants and for spreading activities.

   ##### Fig.10 - Spatial-MultiCriteria Decision analysis process

7. ### Expected results

   Expected results of the projects are:

   1. reducing constraints of treatment strategies for recovering and valorizing nutrients from digestate;
   2. Evaluating fertilization efficiency of treated digestate;
   3. Estimation of NH3 e GHGs emissions from relevant phase of livestock manure digestate chain;
   4. Providing of a dataset for the implementation of ALFAM model for the advancement of knowledge in comprehension and predicting ammonia loss from field-applied digestate in Mediterranean conditions interest;
   5. Techno-economic analysis and territorial assessment of treatment strategies adopted and
   6. a territorial scale analysis to support and integrate mitigation strategies.

8. ### Dissemination activities

   Dissemination of the project results will be ensured through the following actions:
   
   * The production of specific technical materials (technical papers, factsheets, videos...)
   * the organization of specific events (webinars, online seminars, field days...)
   * Publication of scientific papers in open access journals

   The aim is to maximize the scientific impact and the visibility of the project, promoting constant and open debate on project’s contents and results. Dissemination will include scheduled internal meetings among partners to carry on the experimental trials, to define a common communication strategy (logo, template, website, social network profiles, etc.). The internal meetings will be helpful in increasing the multidisciplinary collaborations among partners, in interconnecting their research schemes and in involving the young researchers in the project network and tasks. Regarding the external dissemination, publications in open access scientific peer reviewed journals will be carried out for valorizing at best the achieved results at a scientific level (university, research centers, etc.). Stakeholders, researchers, and students will be invited to seminars and/or workshops to transfer knowledge and foster the debate on project’s scope. Moreover, webinars will be organized to enhance the visibility of the sharing tools developed in the project (e.g., the web app for real time emission presentation). Events will be organized in technical secondary schools as well. The aims of such events will include providing a comprehensive view of the project and of its technical benefits for both farmers and society, improving knowledge on the key aspects investigated in this project and promoting discussion among stakeholders and researchers to have a bottom-up view on the tool’s capabilities and application.
