# Green Cycle System (GCS) by CF Energy Service S.r.l.

<img title="" src="/img/HostFarm.png" alt="" data-align="center" width="502">

The GCS developed by the CF Energy Service S.r.l., is aiming at integrating livestock manure treatment and the production of
sterilized bio-based fertilizers. The plant is located in Capaccio (SA), a small town in the Salerno Province, where are reared more than 20000 buffalo heads for milk production. The plant is fed by three surroundings buffalo farms, connected by pipelines. The total daily processing capacity is of 20500 kg/day of different agricultural organic waste, divided between buffalo manure, olive mill wastewater, dairy serum and other agricultural waste.

The delivered by-products ferment anaerobically, producing biogas and thanks to a cogenerator, 250 kW of electricity and the same amount of thermal energy are produced, entirely reused by the company itself. Furthermore, the by-products, once anaerobically digested, are extracted and separated into a solid and a liquid phase, sterilized by eliminating any toxic bacterial load, aerobically composted, deammonified, and then fed to earthworms which, proceed to a new digestion, allow to obtain very high quality organic fertilizers (lumbricompost), capable of successfully tackling the problem of greenhouse desertification.
