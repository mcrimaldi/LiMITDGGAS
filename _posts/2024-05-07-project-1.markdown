            PhD student at the University of Bologna, Dept. of Agricultural and Food Science and Technology. He earned his bachelor's degree in Agricultural, Forestry, and Environmental Sciences (2019) and a master's in Agricultural Sciences and Technologies (2021) from the University of Naples – Federico II. His master's thesis explored strategies for valorizing livestock manure and reducing its nitrogen content. Grieco's research aims to optimize livestock manure management to mitigate soil, air, and water pollution. He focuses on spatial analysis to assist farms and policymakers in reducing environmental impacts and identifying treatment sites and manure treatment systems for nutrient recovery, including methane production and ammonia stripping. He collaborates with local authorities and the University of Naples Federico II, contributing to scientific papers and conferences, aligning his work with the 2030 Agenda's sustainability goals.
